# Font Setup Instructions

To complete the font setup for the MedAgenda mobile app, please download the following font files from Google Fonts and place them in this directory:

1. [Poppins Regular](https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf)
2. [Poppins Medium](https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/poppins/Poppins-Medium.ttf)
3. [Poppins SemiBold](https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/poppins/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf)
4. [Poppins Bold](https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/poppins/Poppins-Bold.ttf)

After downloading, ensure the files are named exactly as follows:
- `Poppins-Regular.ttf`
- `Poppins-Medium.ttf`
- `Poppins-SemiBold.ttf`
- `Poppins-Bold.ttf`

These fonts are already configured in the app's layout file (`app/_layout.js`). Once you've placed the files in this directory, the fonts will be loaded automatically when the app starts.
